> Version: 2021-06-21

Thank you for downloading the Visual Studio Code icons!

## Contents of this archive

The archive you are looking at contains the following icons:

1. The Visual Studio Code "stable" icon (`vscode`). This blue icon represents Microsoft Visual Studio Code and should be used everywhere as appropriate.
2. The alternate white icon (`vscode-alt`). Use the white variant *only* when there isn't enough contrast otherwise (e.g., on blue backgrounds).

Both icons are available in PNG and SVG format.
